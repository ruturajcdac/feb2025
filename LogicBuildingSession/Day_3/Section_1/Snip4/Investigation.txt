Goal: To print 1 to 9
Actual Output : 1 to 10

To do : adjust the for loop


Q: What is the issue with the loop boundaries? 
A: As the requirement is to print 1 to 9, the loop enters next iteration and prints extra.

Q: How should the loop be adjusted to meet the expected output? 
A: instead of "i <= 10" using "i<10"
