UninitializedWhileLoop.java:16: error: variable count might not have been initialized
                while (count < 10) {
                       ^
1 error



Q: Why does this code produce a compilation error? 
A: The count variable is not initialized to any value, hence it is not available for the condition of while loop.

Q: What needs to be done to initialize the loop variable properly? 
A: The variable has to assigned some value that does not result into any logical error (infinite loop)
