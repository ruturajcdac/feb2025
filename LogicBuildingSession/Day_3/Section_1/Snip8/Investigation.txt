A: It prints just 1, because the variable is initialized to 1 and then decremented inside the body and in the condition part as num is 0, condition is false hence exits the loop.

Q: What adjustments are needed to print the numbers from 1 to 5? 
A:

Initially:
public class OffByOneDoWhileLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 1;
        do {
            System.out.println(num);
            num--;
        } while (num > 0);
    }
}

Later:
public class OffByOneDoWhileLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 1;
        do {
            System.out.println(num);
            num++;                    // changed it to increment
        } while (num < 6);	      // changed the condition to num < 6
    }
}
