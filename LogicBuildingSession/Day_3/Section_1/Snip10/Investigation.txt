Q: Why does the loop execute indefinitely? What is wrong with the loop condition?
A: The loop does not execute indefinitely because the condition is not defined correct. Assignment operator is used instead of any relational operator.
If we want to print 10 to 1 in reverse we can change the condition to num > 0.
