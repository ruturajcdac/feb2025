

Q: Why does the loop print unexpected results or run infinitely?
A: As the variable is updated by 2 at every iteration, some numbers are skipped, so unexpected results are seen.

Q: How should the loop update expression be corrected?
A: In order to print the numbers sequentially, we should increment the variable by 1.

Initially: i += 2

Later: i++
