Error: 

Snip1.java:1: error: class Main is public, should be declared in a file named Main.java
public class Main {
       ^
1 error


Error Explaination:
As the class Main is public, and the file name does not match with the class name, it should be corrected by renaming the file.

Error Solution:
After renaming the file name to Main.java a new error occurs as follows:

E:\POST BE\CDAC\PrepCourse\Day 2\Assignment 2\Snip1>java Main
Error: Main method is not static in class Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)

So doing necessary changes.
