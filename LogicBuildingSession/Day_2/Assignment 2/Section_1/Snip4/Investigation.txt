E:\POST BE\CDAC\PrepCourse\Day 2\Assignment 2\Snip4>java Main
Error: Main method not found in class Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Error Explaination:
The main method declaration is missing  String[] args 

Error Solution:

Defined the main method as:   public static void main(String[] args)



Why is String[] args needed?
String args is an array of strings of Java string class, i.e.,  java.lang.String class. The supplied command-line arguments are stored as an array of String objects in String args in java.

Here, the string type is referred to as args(arguments). A string is typically a collection of characters. However, Java strings refer to an object representing a series of characters. In java, a string object is created using the java.lang.String class.

It is worth noting that It's optional to name the array of strings as args. 
We can use anything after the keyword String.

We can name anything else we like. 

For example, String CDAC[] or Sting yourname[].

However, most coders prefer to name args because that's what other people do.
