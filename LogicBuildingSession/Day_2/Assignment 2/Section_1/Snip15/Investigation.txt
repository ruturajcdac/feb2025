Explaination:
Type Mismatch and Lossy Conversion: Java performs implicit type conversion in some situations, but it does not allow lossy conversions. A double (64-bit floating-point) has more precision than an int (32-bit integer). When you add an int and a double, the result is a double. The compiler recognizes that assigning this double result to an int variable (result) would potentially lose information (the fractional part). Java prevents this automatic lossy conversion to preserve data integrity.

Solution:
Ways to handle:
1) Use double for the result
2) Explicit casting
