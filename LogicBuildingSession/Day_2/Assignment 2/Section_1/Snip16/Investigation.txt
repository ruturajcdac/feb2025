Q: Is the output what you expected?
A: No, Calculation: 10 / 4 = 2 (the fractional part, 0.5, is discarded).

Explaination:
Integer Division: num (an int) is divided by 4 (also an int). In Java, when both operands of the division operator (/) are integers, integer division is performed. This means the result will be an integer, and any fractional part will be truncated (discarded).

Solution:
Ways to handle:
1) Cast num to double:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        double result = (double) num / 4;
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 2.5
    }
}


2) Use a double literal for 4:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        double result = num / 4.0;
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 2.5
    }
}

3) Declare num as a double:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double num = 10;
        double result = num / 4;
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 2.5
    }
}
