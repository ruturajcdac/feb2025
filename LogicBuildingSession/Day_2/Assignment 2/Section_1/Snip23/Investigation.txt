
Output:

Value is 2
Value is 3
Default case

Intended output: 
 
Value is 2


Explaination:

Switch Statement Behavior:

When a case matches the switch expression's value, execution begins at that case.
Without break, execution "falls through" to the subsequent case blocks, regardless of whether their values match. This is called "fall-through" behavior.
The default case is executed if no other case matches.


Solution:
Q: Why "Value is 2" and then "Default case":
A: 
1) "value" is 2, so the case 2 block is executed, printing "Value is 2".
Because there's no break after the println statement in case 2, execution falls through to case 3 and then to the default case.
2) Since there is no break in case 3, the default case is also executed.



Q: How to Prevent Fall-Through:
A: 
Use the break statement at the end of each case block (and before the default block if needed). This will terminate the switch statement once a matching case is executed.
