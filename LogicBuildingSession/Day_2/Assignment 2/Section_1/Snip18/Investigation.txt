Solution:
Operator Precedence: Java follows standard operator precedence rules. Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+).
Multiplication: b * 2 is evaluated first. b is 5, so 5 * 2 = 10.
Addition: a + 10 is then evaluated. a is 10, so 10 + 10 = 20.
Assignment: The result (20) is assigned to the int variable result.
Output: The code prints the value of result, which is 20.
