Explaination:
Invalid Operator: The ** operator, which is commonly used for exponentiation (raising a number to a power) in languages like Python, is not a valid operator in Java. Java does not have a built-in operator for exponentiation.

Solution:
Q: Why ** Is Not Valid in Java:
A: 
1) Language Design: Java's design philosophy prioritizes simplicity and clarity. While exponentiation is a common mathematical operation, the language designers chose not to include a dedicated exponentiation operator.

2) Alternative: Math.pow(): Instead of **, Java provides the Math.pow() method in the Math class for performing exponentiation. This method takes two double arguments (base and exponent) and returns a double result.
