Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at Main.main(Main.java:12)

Explaination:

It throws an ArithmeticException at runtime. Specifically, it will be a java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero.

Q: Why the Exception Occurs:

1) Division by Zero: The line int result = a / b; attempts to divide the integer a (10) by the integer b (0).

2) Mathematical Undefinedness: In mathematics, division by zero is undefined. There is no finite number that, when multiplied by zero, results in a non-zero number.

3) Java's Behavior: Java, like most programming languages, cannot represent or handle undefined mathematical operations. When the JVM encounters a division by zero with integer operands, it throws an ArithmeticException.

Solution:
Q: Why Division by Zero Causes an Issue in Java:

1) Mathematical Inconsistency: Allowing division by zero would lead to mathematical inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior.

2) Preventing Errors: Throwing an exception is a way for Java to signal that an error has occurred. This helps programmers identify and correct potential problems in their code.

3) Floating-Point Division (Different Behavior): It's worth noting that if a and b were double or float types, division by zero would not throw an exception. Instead, it would result in Infinity (if a is positive), -Infinity (if a is negative), or NaN (Not-a-Number) if both are zero. Integer division behaves differently to floating point division.

4) Program Stability: By forcing a crash with an exception, the program is prevented from continuing with potentially corrupted or incorrect data.
