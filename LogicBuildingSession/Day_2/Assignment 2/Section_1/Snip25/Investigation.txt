Switch.java:4: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
                switch(score) {
                      ^
1 error

Explaination:

the switch statement does not support double values as the expression to be switched on. And we are comparing the double variable with integer cases.

Solution:
Q: What does the error tell you about the types allowed in switch expressions?
A:
Allowed switch Types (Pre-Java 17):

1) byte, short, char, int
2) enum types
3) String (from Java 7 onwards)

Q: How can you modify the code to make it work?
A: make the variable to be checked as int
