Error explaination:
y is not declared or initialised before getting used.

Explaination:
Q: Why must variables be declared?
A: 1)  Memory Allocation:
When you declare a variable, you tell the compiler to allocate a specific amount of memory to store that variable's value. Without a declaration, the compiler doesn't know how much memory to reserve.
   
   2)Data Type Enforcement:
Declarations specify the data type of a variable (e.g., int, float, String). This allows the compiler to perform type checking, ensuring that you're using the variable correctly. For example, it prevents you from accidentally trying to add a string to an integer.

   3)Preventing Ambiguity:
Without declarations, the compiler wouldn't know if y was intended to be an integer, a floating-point number, or some other data type. This ambiguity would make it impossible to generate correct machine code.

  4)Code Clarity:
Declaring variables makes your code more readable. It tells anyone reading the code what type of data a variable will hold.
