Switch.java:28: error: duplicate case label
                        case 5:
                        ^
1 error

Explaination:

The error "duplicate case label" indicates that we have the same case value appearing more than once within our switch statement.

Solution:
Q: Why "Duplicate Case Label" is an Error ?

A: Switch Statement Logic:
The switch statement is designed to execute a specific block of code based on the value of the expression being switched.
Each case label represents a unique value that the switch expression might have.
If you have two case labels with the same value, the compiler becomes confused: "Which block of code should I execute if this value occurs?"
