Main.java:17: error: reached end of file while parsing
}
 ^
1 error

Explaination:

In the code snippet, the compiler reports an error " reached end of file while parsing " because the main method's closing brace is absent.



Solution:
Q : What does the compiler say about mismatched braces?
A: 
When the compiler encounters mismatched braces (like a missing closing brace), it produces a syntax error.
