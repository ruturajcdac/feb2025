Main method with String[] args

Explaination:
Q: Can you have multiple main methods? 
A: Yes, as per the given snippet it is observed that we can have multiple main methods, but only one of them can have the specific signature "public static void main(String[] args)". This is the entry point that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for when executing a program.

Q: What do you observe?
A: This is valid Java syntax because method overloading is allowed. Method overloading means you can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

JVM Entry Point:
When you run the Java program, the JVM specifically searches for the public static void main(String[] args) method.
The other main method (public static void main(int[] args)) is simply treated as another overloaded method. It will not be automatically executed by the JVM at startup.

In summary, while you can define multiple methods named main, only the one with the String[] args signature serves as the program's entry point.
