Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at Main.main(Main.java:19)


Explaination:
Q: Why the Exception Occurs:
A: 
1) null Reference: The line String str = null; assigns the value null to the str variable. null means that the variable does not refer to any object in memory. It essentially means "no object."

2) Dereferencing null: The line System.out.println(str.length()); attempts to call the length() method on the str variable. However, since str is null, there is no object to call the method on. This is called "dereferencing a null pointer."
 
3) NullPointerException: When we try to access a member (method or variable) of an object that is null, the JVM throws a NullPointerException. This indicates that we're trying to perform an operation on something that doesn't exist.
