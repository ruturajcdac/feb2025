Explaination:

Missing Semicolon: The System.out.println("Hello, World") statement is missing a semicolon (;) at the end.

Q: Why the Exception Occurs:

1) Division by Zero: The line int result = a / b; attempts to divide the integer a (10) by the integer b (0).

2) Mathematical Undefinedness: In mathematics, division by zero is undefined. There is no finite number that, when multiplied by zero, results in a non-zero number.

3) Java's Behavior: Java, like most programming languages, cannot represent or handle undefined mathematical operations. When the JVM encounters a division by zero with integer operands, it throws an ArithmeticException.

Solution:
Q : How the Missing Semicolon Affects Compilation:
A: 
1) Compilation Failure: The Java compiler requires that most statements end with a semicolon. The semicolon acts as a statement terminator, signaling to the compiler that the statement is complete.

2) Error Message: When the compiler encounters the missing semicolon, it will generate a compilation error. The error message will typically indicate that a semicolon is expected at the end of the line or before the closing curly brace (}).

3) No Executable Code: Because of the syntax error, the compiler will not be able to generate the .class file (the compiled bytecode). Therefore, the program will not be executable.

4) The compiler will not know where one statement ends and the next begins, so it is unable to parse the code correctly.
