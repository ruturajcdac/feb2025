
Output:

Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Unknown level

Intended output: 
 
Level 1


Explaination:

How the Code Executes:

level is initialized to 1.
The switch statement finds a match at case 1.
"Level 1" is printed.
No break: Execution continues to the next case block (case 2).
"Level 2" is printed.
No break: Execution continues to the next case block (case 3).
"Level 3" is printed.
No break: Execution continues to the default block.
"Unknown level" is printed.
The switch statement ends.

Solution:
Q: The Role of break:

A: The break statement's purpose within a switch statement is to terminate the execution of the switch block immediately.
When a break is encountered, the program jumps to the statement following the switch block.
Without break, the program "falls through" to the next case (or default) regardless of whether the case value matches the switch expression.
